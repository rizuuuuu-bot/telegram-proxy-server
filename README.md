## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Custom Proxy Secret

```

### Multiple Channels

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t telegram-proxy .

# Run the container
docker run -p 5000:5000 -p 1080:1080 -p 443:443 \
  -e SPONSOR_CHANNEL=@your_channel \
  telegram-proxy
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port 443 Permission Denied**
   - On local development, use a different port (e.g., 8443)
   - Railway handles port binding automatically

2. **Channel Not Appearing**
   - Ensure your channel username is correct (include @)
   - Check that the channel is public
   - Verify the MTProto implementation is working

3. **Connection Refused**
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify the server is listening on 0.0.0.0
   - Ensure Railway environment variables are set

### Logs
Check application logs in Railway dashboard or locally:
```bash
python app.py --debug
```
